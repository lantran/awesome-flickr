# Awesome photos from Flickr

This project is my very first attempt to build a web app using JavaScript and related frameworks with Flickr API.
You can see the [demo](http://lantran.github.io/public/#/) here.
### Technology stack
In this project, I use:

 * [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
 * [Boostrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
 * [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
 * [Blueimp gallery](http://blueimp.github.io/Bootstrap-Image-Gallery/)


### Features
Fortunately, the app can do something for you:
 
 *  Pull and display public photos from Flickr initially. 
```
flickr.photos.getRecent
Returns a list of the latest public photos uploaded to flickr.
```
 * Seaching based on text input. A search with no text input will redirect you to the initial page which latest photos are showed.
```
flickr.photos.search
Return a list of photos matching some criteria. Only photos visible to the calling user
which title, description or tags contain the text will be returned.

```
 * Display each photo in a lightbox when you click on individual one. If you click on the 
 photo one more time, then you can see the title and the effect created by blueimp (It's very nice you
 should try it.)  

Happy coding! :)
